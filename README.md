# Hello-World
# Overview

My software greets the user with a friendly "Hello World!". It's very cute and very happy. 

My purpose in creating this software is so I could practice making up my repository.
I learned interesting things about how ReadMe files work and uploading file to GitHub. This was a good experience for me to learn more.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create this program on my laptop. I coded the program in Python.
Python is a simple to use and my the very first language I learned so it is important to me
because of nostalgia. How cute.
